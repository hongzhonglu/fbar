Description: A simple package for Flux Balance Analysis and related
    metabolic modelling techniques. Functions are provided for: parsing
    models in tabular format, converting parsed metabolic models to input
    formats for common linear programming solvers, and
    evaluating and applying gene-protein-reaction mappings. In addition, there
    are wrappers to parse a model, select a solver, find the metabolic fluxes,
    and return the results applied to the original model. Compared to other
    packages in this field, this package puts a much heavier focus on
    providing reusable components that can be used in the design of new
    implementation of new techniques, in particular those that involve large
    parameter sweeps.

## Resumbmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Added checks to test and examples so that they are skipped correctly when no appropriate LP solver is available.
- Added more documentation and examples on use of different LP solvers

## Test environments
* ubuntu 12.04, R 3.3.2
* ubuntu 14.04, R 3.3.2
* ubuntu 12.04, devel and release (on travis-ci)
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
